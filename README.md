RC Car

## The Car

The idea is to build a remote-controlled (RC) car using two Arduinos. One will be the car controller which would be mounted on the car chassis and the other one would act as the remote-control (using analog joystick module).

## The Torret

It would be nice to build a torret-like mechanism on top of the chassis to control a ESP32-CAM module remotely.
